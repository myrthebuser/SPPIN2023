# The SPPIN challenge
The aim of this challenge is to create a segmentation tool for surgical planning in neuroblastoma patients.. Since each MRI sequence can provide other structural information, this challenge provides unregistered, multi-parametric MRI data.  We encourage teams to explore the possibilities of the multi-parametric data to obtain the best segmentation results in this complex challenge. The neuroblastoma segmentation is fully supervised, with labels for every patient in the dataset. More information can be found at https://sppin.grand-challenge.org/news/ .
